# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
## [1.3.0] - 2020-01-21

### Changed

- dependency on rails has been increased from 4.2 to > 5.
  -  this changed a lot in the test cases, nothing in the actual library.

## [1.2.2] - 2016-07-26

### Changed

- dependency from osc-machete 1.1 to 1.2 which ups the pbs dependency to 2.0

### Fixed

- use latest version of osc-machete gem so `Job#host` exists so after submitting a
  job we save the host to the database

## [1.2.1] - 2016-07-26

### Fixed

- bug where `results_valid?` might not call results validation method

## [1.2.0] - 2016-06-07

### Changed

- remove `AwesimRails` as a dependency
- README and spec changes for rubygems release
- `Workflow#staging_target_dir` now accepts `dataroot` path keyword argument
- change Rails dependency to allow any minor version of Rails 4

## [1.1.0] - 2016-03-03

### Fixed

- fix precompiling assets when a database is not available (which almost always happens when you go to share an app)

### Changed

- status_label view helper now accepts a second optional argument specifying the tag that wraps the label (defaults to span)
- status_label view helper now adds the class `status_label` to the labels for easier customization of the labels

## [1.0.1] - 2016-02-19

### Fixed

- Fix module used so Statusable.update_status_of_all_active_jobs is called on each request

## 1.0.0 - 2016-02-03

This release notes changes from existing files pulled out of osc-machete gem and
added features and fixed defects that this gem introduces.

### Fixed

- `update_status!` on the `Job` models (models that include `OscMacheteRails::Statusable`) is called at beginning of each request instead of in the `after_find` hook, so you no longer need to preload to trigger the update (a big hangup we had earlier for each new developer)
- even if you did preload for the `Job` models, superfluous sql calls were being made for each model - this was eliminated
- with the latest version of torque new status values were causing problems with status display on simulations. Introducing the Status value object fixed this problem
- proper error handling avoided various odd behavior that resulted if job submission failed

### Added

- Rails generators to scaffold a workflow
- status_label helper to replace the one previously manually added or generated by Rails application template (this one handles Status values appropriately)
- Initialization option: change OscMacheteRails.update_status_of_all_active_jobs_on_each_request to false if you want to disable the update of all active jobs on each request
- workflow.rb: before_destroy we stop all of the jobs and if that succeeds we delete the staged directory if "staged_dir" exists on model that has a workflow
- statusable.rb: Added Statusable#stop to allow qdel-ing the job. This could be used to implement a stop feature if you wanted to stop a simulation but keep from deleting the files it had created so far.


### Changed

workflow.rb (from v0.6.3 of osc-machete to latest osc_machete_rails)

- in module OscMacheteRails instead of OSC::Machete::SimpleJob
- handle errors when submitting jobs, logging the error and setting it on the model#errors object
- if submitting a job fails, we delete the staged directory that was created during submission

statusable.rb (from v0.6.3 of osc-machete to latest osc_machete_rails)

- in module OscMacheteRails instead of OSC::Machete::SimpleJob
- models that include Statutable no longer are updated via after_find hook. instead a new class method "update_status_of_all_active_jobs" is called to call `Statusable#update_status!` on each instance that is in an active state (running, queued, etc.). this is called at the beginning of each request via a before_action hook on the application controller.
- update_status! handles PBS::Error's when checking the status, logs an error in the log and then leaves the model untouched
- Statusable#status returns OSC::Machete::Status object instead of a character
- Statusable#status= can accept a character, nil or an OSC::Machete::Status
- Statusable#job= lets you set the attributes of an OSC::Machete::Job object to the Statusable model. Backwards compatibility supports saving the attributes script_name, job_path, and pbsid. New models produced by the generators use a job_cache column that stores a hash, and script, pbsid, and host are saved here instead.
- setters `script_name=` and `job_path=` do not exist on models that are generated using the generators (models that have a job_cache column)
