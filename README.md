# OscMacheteRails

Build and manage simulation workflows.

## Installation

To use, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'osc_machete_rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install --local


If you don't have osc_machete_rails installed, you can do so by:

1. clone this repo
2. checkout the tag you want to build
3. `rake install`

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of the repo via bundler's git option:

    gem 'osc_machete_rails', :git => 'git@github.com:AweSim-OSC/osc_machete_rails.git'


## Usage

For now, look at the developer documentation and tutorials on the AweSim dashboard.
