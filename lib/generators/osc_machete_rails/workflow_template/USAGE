Description:
    Stubs out a new workflow template. Pass the template name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as
    arguments.

    Attribute pairs are field:type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

    This generates a batch script in jobs/.

Example:
    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:workflow_template Thing pressure:decimal`

    Creates:
        Template:   jobs/thing/main.sh.mustache
