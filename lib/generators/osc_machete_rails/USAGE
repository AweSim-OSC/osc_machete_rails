Description:
    Scaffolds an entire workflow, from models and migrations to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your Workflow.

    Pass the name of the workflow (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attributes are field arguments specifying the model's attributes. You can
    optionally pass the type and an index to each field. For instance:
    "title body:text tracking_id:integer:uniq" will generate a title field of
    string type, a body with text type and a tracking_id as an integer with an
    unique index. "index" could also be given instead of "uniq" if one desires
    a non unique index.

    Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to specify them by hand
    as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'osc_machete_rails:scaffold container name pressure:decimal'
    gives you a workflow model with those two attributes, a workflow template,
    a job model, a controller that handles the
    create/show/update/destroy/submit/copy, forms to create and edit your
    posts, and an index that lists them all, as well as a resources :containers
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'rails destroy osc_machete_rails:scaffold WorkflowName'.

Examples:
    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:scaffold structure`
    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:scaffold fan name comments:text centrifugal:boolean`
    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:scaffold heatsink material temperature:decimal`
