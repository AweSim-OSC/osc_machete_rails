Description:
    Stubs out a new workflow model. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

Example:
    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:workflow_model Thing`

    This will create:
        Model:          app/models/thing.rb
        Test:           test/models/thing_test.rb
        Fixtures:       test/fixtures/things.yml
        Migration:      db/migrate/XXX_create_things.rb

    Note:
        It will default to using the Job model for its Machete jobs.

    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:workflow_model Container name:string pressure:decimal container_job:jobs`

    This will do all of above as well as set the ContainerJob as its Machete jobs.
