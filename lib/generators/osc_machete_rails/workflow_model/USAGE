Description:
    Stubs out a new workflow model. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are field:type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

    This generator invokes your configured ORM and test framework, which
    defaults to ActiveRecord and TestUnit.

Available field types:

    For more information see:

        `rails generate model --help`

Example:
    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:workflow_model Thing`

        For ActiveRecord and TestUnit it creates:
            Model:      app/models/thing.rb
            Test:       test/models/thing_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/things.yml
            Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_create_things.rb

        Note:
            It will default to using the Job model for its Machete jobs.

    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:workflow_model Container
        name:string pressure:decimal container_job:jobs`

        Note:
            This will do all of above as well as set the ContainerJob as its
            Machete jobs.
