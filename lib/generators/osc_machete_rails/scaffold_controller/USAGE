Description:
    Stubs out a scaffolded controller, its seven RESTful actions + two Workflow
    actions and related views. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored. The controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of
    the model name.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers and invokes helper,
    template engine and test framework generators.

Example:
    `rails generate osc_machete_rails:scaffold_controller Thing`

    Thing controller with URLs like /thing/submit.
        Controller: app/controllers/things_controller.rb
        Test:       test/controllers/things_controller_test.rb
        Views:      app/views/things/index.html.erb [...]
        Helper:     app/helpers/things_helper.rb
